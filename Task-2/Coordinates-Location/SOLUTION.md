In Step-I:
mkdir Coordinates-Location to create the directory.
In Step-II:
mkdir North to create a sub-directory.
In that I added 3 different files using the cat command: cat >file.txt
And then I appended the 3 files to a single file NorthCoordinate.txt using cat command:
cat NDegree.txt NMinutes.txt NSeconds.txt >NorthCoordinate.txt
Then we renamed the file as North.txt using cat command.
In Step-III:
mkdir East to create a sub-directory.
In that I added 3 different files using the cat command: cat >file.txt
And then I appended the 3 files to a single file NorthCoordinate.txt using cat command:
cat EDegree.txt EMinutes.txt ESeconds.txt >EastCoordiate.txt
Then we renamed the file as South.txt using cat command.
In 
In Step IV:
Make a common file named Location-Coordinate.txt appending the 2 files
In Step V:
Using git add, git commit and git push command push the files to a repository
